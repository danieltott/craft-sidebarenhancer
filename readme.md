# Craft Sidebar Enhancer

With Craft 2.5 came a redesigned control panel. Although pretty, it takes a lot more clicks just to find the setting you're looking for. Not anymore! Craft Sidebar Enhancer adds extended options to Craft's existing sidebar.

Just like the gear option in previous versions of Craft, Craft Sidebar Enhancer adds both system & general options back to the central navigation - no longer requring an extra step to the 'settings' button.

### Installation
Create a `sidebarenhancer` folder inside `craft/plugins` directory and drop the contents of this repository inside.
